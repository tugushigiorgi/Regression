# Regression and  Classification for [ Used Car Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishabhkarn/used-car-dataset?resource=download)

## I have used :
  - Simple linear Regression : how the kms_driven of the car is related to its price 
  - Multiple linear Regression : To see what effect Independent variables : seats , kms_driven , mileage(kmpl), engine(cc), max_power(bhp), torque(Nm)   has on the Car  price  
  - A decision tree regression model 
  - logistic regression model :in order to classify, I introduce a new column [affordable] Depending on its price, is it affordable or not?
  - A decision tree classification model
